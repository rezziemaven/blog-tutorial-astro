Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning [Astro](https://astro.build)! Here is where I'll share my learning journey as I build this blog.

## What I've accomplished so far:

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts to deploy it to the web here!

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next?

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then _maybe_ keep adding more posts. Watch this space ;)

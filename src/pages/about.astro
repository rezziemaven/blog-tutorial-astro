		<p>I'm Rezzie, a developer that loves using code to solve problems that help others.</p>

    <p>This site was built to test <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>, a framework that promises to be even better than <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>. After recommendation from a coworker currently using it for his developer portfolio and reviewing a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-ive-ditched-nextjs-forever-astro-alexandru-t%C4%83sic%C4%83-z7zxf" target="_blank">comparison article</a> about these two frameworks, I was convinced to try it to see if it would be a good use for my new online developer portfolio.</p>
